# SolrWayback

## SolrWayback 3.2 software bundle released
Scroll down to the install guide below and follow the instructions.


## About SolrWayback
SolrWayback will only work with warc-indexer version 3.0+

SolrWayback is web-application for browsing historical harvested ARC/WARC files similar
to the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. The SolrWayback depends on a Solr server where
Arc/Warc files have been indexed using the British Library WARC-Indexer. 
Unlike the Wayback Machine the SolrWayback does not need the
CDX-server with meta data for the harvest. It only uses the Solr server and the raw
Arc/Warc files.

 Warc-indexer: https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery/tree/master/warc-indexer<br>
 Netsearch(Archon/Arctika): https://github.com/netarchivesuite/netsearch<br>



SolrWayback comes with additional features:
* Image search similar to google images
* Search by uploading a file. (image/pdf etc.) See if the resource has been harvested and from where.
* Link graph showing links (ingoing/outgoing) for domains using the D3 javascript framework.
* Raw download of any harvested resource from the binary Arc/Warc file.
* Export a search resultset to a Warc-file. Streaming download, no limit of size of resultset.
* Build in SOCKS proxy to view historical webpages without browser leaking resources from the live web.

## Streaming export
Any search result can be exported to WARC format. If any of the documents are indexed as ARC format, they will be converted to WARC format. There is useful when extracting a corpus  (typical specific domains). There is no limit to the size of the export.
Text information about a corpus can also be exported as a CSV file.


## SOCKS proxy - No leaking to the live web
Solrwayback starts up listing on two ports. The default port 8080 and then port 9000 for SOCKS proxy v.4 mode.
The default SOCKS  proxy port in the property file is 9000.
Configure your browser to run SOCKS v4 to <solrwaybackurl> port 9000
Ie. localhost port 9000
You can still connect to solrwayback without SOCKS mode to the normal port 8080.
This useful so the page can be seen both with and without leaking, using two different browsers with 1 using SOCKS v.4 mode.


## Root servlet. Catching and forwarding live leaks.
Installing the root-servlet will improve playback of sites that are leaking urls. The root-servlet will
catch relative leaks (same domain) even without using proxy mode. Live leakes that are absolute (http://...) will
only be catch if running proxy mode. The leaks will then be redirected back into SolrWayback to the correct URL and crawltime.
The root-servlet is included in the bundle install. In Tomcat it must be named ROOT.war.

## API
The API for linking to and browsing archived webpages is the same as for Internet Archive:<br>

Internet Archive:https://web.archive.org/web/20080213093319/http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/ <br>
SolrWayback: http://server/solrwayback/services/web/20140515140841/http://statsbiblioteket.dk/ <br>

If using a Solr search based web archive such as Shine (https://github.com/netarchivesuite/shine) or Warclight (https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight)
you only need to change to property pointing from the wayback server to the SolrWayback server.

## Warc-indexer/Solr 
All entries from the arc/warc files are indexed as separate documents using the WARC-Indexer and using the lucene schema required by the WARCIndexer.

A document is Solr can be html, image, video, audio, js etc. (content_type_norm)
Filename and offset of a document in warc files is stored in solr and will be used and loaded during playback.
 

# SolrWayback software bundle 3.2 install guide


With this download you will be able to index, search and playback web pages from your warc-files.
The bundle contains Solr, the warc-indexer tool and Solrwayback installed on a Tomcat webserver.
Just unzip the bundle and copy two files to your home directory and explore your warc files. 

## Download
Download : https://github.com/netarchivesuite/solrwayback/releases/download/3.2.1/solrwayback_package.zip  
Unzip and follow the instructions below.
 

## Requirements:
Works on MacOs/Linux/Windows.  
For the Solrwayback software bundle you only need to have Java 8 (64 bit) installed. 
To check java is installed, type the following from a prompt: java -version  
Any version 1.8+ will be compatible.  

## Install instructions:

### 1) Upgrade from 3.1

To update from 3.1 add the new additional properties in solrwaybackweb.properties and solrwayback.properties. Download the release and to see the new properties. Also the map properties has been renamed.
Replace the war-file in tomcat with this release and the add new root servlet (ROOT.WAR) and restart tomcat. Both war-files are attachments to this release to be downloaded (apache-tomcat-8.5.29/webapps/ folder)

### 1) INITIAL SETUP  
Properties:  
Copy the two files solrwayback.properties and solrwaybackweb.properties to your HOME folder.

Optional: For screenshot previews to work you may have to edit solrwayback.properties and change the value of the last two properties : chrome.command  and screenshot.temp.imagedir. 
Chrome(Chromium) must has to be installed for screenshot preview images.  

Optional: For socks proxy mode to work optimal, add the host-name and IP for the server to the whitelist in solrwayback.properties

If there are errors when running a script, try change the permissions for the file (startup.sh etc). Linux: chmod +x filename.sh

### 2) STARTING SOLRWAYBACK  
Solrwayback requires both Solr and Tomcat to be running. 

Tomcat:  
Start tomcat: apache-tomcat-8.5.29/bin/startup.sh  
Stop tomcat:  apache-tomcat-8.5.29/bin/shutdown.sh  
(For windows navigate to apache-tomcat-8.5.29/bin/ and type startup.bat or shutdown.bat )  
To see Tomcat is running open: http://localhost:8080/solrwayback/  
This is the search interface frontpage  

Solr:  
Start solr: solrwayback_package/solr-7.5.0/bin/solr start  
Stop solr: solrwayback_package/solr-7.5.0/bin/solr stop  
(For windows navigate to solrwayback_package/solr-7.5.0/bin/ and type solr.cmd start or solr.cmd stop)    
To see Solr is running open: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/netarchivebuilder  

### 3) INDEXING
Solrwayback uses a Solr index of warc files and makes the archived webpages searchable and viewable.  
If you do not have existing warc files, see steps below on harvesting with wget.        

Creating an index:
Copy arc/warc files into folder: /solrwayback_package/indexing/warcs  
Start indexing:  call indexing/batch_warc_folder.sh  
Indexing can take up to 10 minutes/GB files. After indexing, the warc-files must stay in the same folder for solrwayback to work.  
Having whitespace characters in warc file names can result in pagepreviews and playback not working on some OS.
There can be up to 5 minutes delay before the indexed files are visible from search. Visit this url after index job have finished to commit them instantly: http://localhost:8983/solr/netarchivebuilder/update?commit=true  

Deleting an Index:  
If you want to index a new collection into solr and remove the old index.  
1) stop solr  
2) delete the folder:   
solr-7.5.0/server/solr/netarchivebuilder/netarchivebuilder_data/index  
(or rename to index1 etc, you if later want to switch back)  
3) start solr  
4) start the indexing script. 

Faster indexing:  
Copy batch_warc_folder.sh and rename to batch_warc1_folder.sh . Also create a warcs1 folder. Edit the batch_warc1_folder.sh script and change the foldername from warcs to warcs1.  
This way you can start two index jobs running at the same time. A powerful laptop can handle up to 4 simultaneous indexing processes. 
You can also just add more warc files to the index without having to index all content in the warc folder again.  
Major solrwayback performance improvement for searching and playback by having the solrwayback_package folder on a SSD.  


### 4) SEARCHING AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES  
Solrwayback provides a search interface to explore the content of the warc files that have been indexed.  
The basic query in solrwayback will return all documents in the index: *:*  
Results can then be filtered by fields like Domain, Content Type Norm, Crawl Year, Status Code, Public Suffix (tld).  
Advanced queries can be constructed using Boolean terms, and searching fields eg: domain:statsbiblioteket.dk AND title:"Aarhus University Library"  

Additional features include:  
- Image search similar to google images  
- Search by uploading a file. (image/pdf etc.) See if the resource has been harvested and from where.  
- Link graph showing links (ingoing/outgoing) for domains using the D3 javascript framework.  
- Raw download of any harvested resource from the binary Arc/Warc file.  
- Export a search resultset to a Warc-file. Streaming download, no limit of size of resultset.  
- An optional built in SOCKS proxy can be used to view historical webpages without browser leaking resources from the live web. Configure browser to SOCKS version 4 to localhost port 9000 and open http://localhost:8080/solrwayback/

### 5) TO CREATE YOUR OWN WARCS - HARVESTING WITH WGET  
How to do your own web harvest websites (Linux/MacOS only):  
Using the wget command is an easy way to harvest websites compared to using Heritrix. The warc-files can then be indexed into SolrWayback.  
Create a new folder since there will be several files written in this folder. Navigate to that folder in a prompt.  
Create a text file call url_list.txt with one URL pr. line in that folder.  
Type the following in a prompt:  
wget  --level=0  --warc-cdx   --page-requisites --warc-file=warcfilename --warc-max-size=1G -i url_list.txt    
(rename the warcfilename to your liking)  
The script will harvest all pages in the url_list.txt file with all resources required for that page (images, css etc.) and be written to a warc file(s) called warcfilename.warc  
Change --level=0 to --level=1 for following links. This will substantially increase the size of the warc file(s).
